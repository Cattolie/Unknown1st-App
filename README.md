This github hack was submitted by a new user. You may use this correctly on your own as you like, but only from your own point of view. This implies that you should not use this hack for everyone, or, to put it another way, DO NOT CREATE THIS HACK THAT MAKES IT OBVIOUS THAT YOU ARE USING THESE HACKS. If you do, your class will no longer be able to play blooket, and you will have no choice to utilize blooket as an additional credit, for example.
